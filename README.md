## Introduction

**qbic-pipelines/vcftomat** is a bioinformatics pipeline that ...

1. Indexes (g.)vcf files ([`tabix`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html))
2. Converts g.vcf files to vcf with `genotypegvcf` ([`GATK`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us))
3. Concatenates all vcfs that have the same id and the same label with `bcftools/concat` ([`bcftools`](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html))
4. Changes the sample name in the vcf file to the filename with `bcftools/reheader` ([`bcftools`](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html)) - This can be turned off by adding `--rename false` to the `nextflow run` command.
5. Merges all vcfs from the same sample with `bcftools/merge` ([`bcftools`](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html))
6. Converts the (merged) vcfs to a matrix using a custom R script written by @ellisdoro ([`R`](https://www.r-project.org/))
7. Collects all reports into a MultiQC report ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core
     workflows use the "tube map" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/design_guidelines#examples for examples.   -->
<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->2. Present QC for raw reads ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Describe the minimum required steps to execute the pipeline, e.g. how to prepare samplesheets.
     Explain what rows and columns represent. For instance (please edit as appropriate):

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,label,gvcf,vcf_path,vcf_index_path
SAMPLE-1,pipelineA-callerA,false,path/to/vcf.gz,path/to/.vcf.gz.tbi
SAMPLE-1,pipelineB-callerA,false,path/to/vcf.gz,path/to/.vcf.gz.tbi
SAMPLE-2,pipelineB-callerB,true,path/to/g.vcf.gz,path/to/g.vcf.gz.tbi
SAMPLE-2,pipelineB-callerB,true,path/to/g.vcf.gz,path/to/g.vcf.gz.tbi
```

Each row represents a VCF file coming from a sample. The `label` column enables concatenation of vcfs (for example when the pipeline produces different vcfs for chrM and chrY). The `gvcf` column indicates whether the file is a g.vcf file or not. The `vcf_path` and `vcf_index_path` columns contain the path to the VCF file and its index, respectively.

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run qbic-pipelines/vcftomat \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
